    <h3>A Passion for Testing</h3>
    <p>I am a Computer Science student with a newly discovered passion for Software Testing. Design affects everything in our life from how a webpage is structured to the color of your walls. Testing is the only way for creators to know if their customers will like both the functionality and the style of their product. I love testing software and all that it has taught me about the design of the world.</p>
