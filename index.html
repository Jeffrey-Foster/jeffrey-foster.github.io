    <h3>A Passion for Testing</h3>
    <p>I am a Computer Science student with a newly discover passion for Software Testing. Design affects everything in our life from how aa webpage is structured to the color of your walls. Testing is only way for creators to know if their customers will like their product, both its functionality and its style. I love testing software and all that it has taught me about the functionalities of the things in our lives and the design of our world.</p>
